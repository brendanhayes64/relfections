When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	
	If you want to share your work with others, may need to work on it from different computers and it is good to use as a backup in case your computer dies.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There may be times when you are working on some functionality that may break with a newer version or are working on an experimental branch that was pulled from older version
