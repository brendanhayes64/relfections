What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	It creates a new .git directory with 0 commits. You need this so you can start committing files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area lets you control which files to commit and when. It allows for grouping files and then commit all at once.
